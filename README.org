* Introduction

Paperspan HTML export to Instapaper CSV import. With `folders.yaml`
configuration file, which contains Instapaper target folder names (for
output file) and /regular expressions/ for `URL` or `text` in Paperspan
export (which is input). Each of the selectors in the configuration file (I have thousands) is matched against the URL or text of the Paperspan link being umported, until a match is found and a folder can be designated to it.
    
Usage: see the Makefile.
