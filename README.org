* Introduction

Paperspan HTML export to Instapaper CSV import with automatic designation to folders.

Usage: see the [[https://github.com/maridonkers/paperspan2instapaper/blob/master/Makefile][Makefile]].

Paperspan HTML export to Instapaper CSV import. With [[https://github.com/maridonkers/paperspan2instapaper/blob/master/folders-example.yaml][folders.yaml]]
configuration file, which contains Instapaper target folder names (for
output file) and /regular expressions/ for =URL= or =text= in Paperspan
export (which is input). Each of the selectors in the configuration file (I have thousands) is matched against the URL or text of the Paperspan link being umported, until a match is found and an associated folder can be designated to it. This is very useful when you have a lot of undesignated links in your Paperspan (which you did not already move to a folder in Paperspan).

e.g. the Paperspan link

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<a href="https://news360.com/article/563394549" time_added="1630495255000">Stop prescribing hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19, warn researchers | Stop News – India TV</a>
#+END_SRC

is matched with the following selector from [[https://github.com/maridonkers/paperspan2instapaper/blob/master/folders-example.yaml][folders.yaml]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  - "conditionRegExp": "\\bcovid-19\\b"
    "conditionSource": "text"
    "conditionFolderName": "biologyHealth"
#+END_SRC

which results in designation to the =Biology Health= folder via its folderName (also in [[https://github.com/maridonkers/paperspan2instapaper/blob/master/folders-example.yaml][folders.yaml]]).

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  - "folderName": "biologyHealth"
    "folderPath": "Biology Health"
#+END_SRC

and the following CSV line is the result:

#+BEGIN_SRC csv
  https://news360.com/article/563394549,"Stop prescribing hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19, warn researchers | Stop News – India TV",https://news360.com/article/563394549,"Biology Health",1630495255000
#+END_SRC
